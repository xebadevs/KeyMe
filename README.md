# About KeyMe 🔐

The major objective of this project was to implement Databases, using MySQL.

The initial idea included just that and make some CRUDs (create, read, update, delete): the heart of a database connection.

But... news ideas were emerging in the process, so at the end includes also:

- Backend validations.

- Encryption and Decryption methods.

- E-mail recovering password system.
