## About KeyMe üîê

The major objective of this project was to implement Databases, using MySQL.

The initial idea included just that and make some CRUDs (create, read, update, delete): the heart of a database connection.

But... news ideas were emerging in the process, so at the end includes also:

- DDBB construction.

- A login / logout system.

- Backend validations.

- Encryption and Decryption methods.

- E-mail recovering password system.

- Configuration and running of the DDBB on an external hosting.

<br>



## Build With

- `PHP 7+`.
- `MySQL` for Database Management.
- `PHPMailer` as PHP Mailing Library.
- `Semantic UI` as CSS Framework.

Extra Tools:
- `Photoshop` for the portfolio images edition.

<br>



## Local Use

A local usage should include not just a local server distribution program but also the construction itself of the database.

So in this case we do not recommend a local use.
